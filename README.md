## Why Eos?
**Eos** = the first light. This repo holds the patterns, contracts, and templates that everything else orbits.

## What‚Äôs inside (starter layout)


/docs/ # Design notes, architecture, ADRs
/packages/ # Libraries, UI kits, SDKs (monorepo-friendly)
/services/ # Backends, workers, APIs
/apps/ # User-facing apps (web, desktop, mobile)
/tooling/ # CLIs, dev scripts, codegen
/templates/ # Project scaffolds, ISSUE/PR templates

You can start minimal (one app, one service) and grow into a monorepo.

---
# Getting Started
## 1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/QiLife-Eos.git

---
## 2) Optional:

---
## 3) Run whatever starter app you seed into /apps

Standards (tl;dr)

Language: JS/TS + Python, typed where possible.

Packages: pnpm workspaces for Node; uv/pipx for Python tools.

Style: Prettier + ESLint; Black + Ruff (Python).

Commits: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)
