"""Helpers for spawning and streaming subprocesses.

These functions are used by the cockpit to launch miniapps as separate
processes and forward their output back to the user. They can also be
imported by miniapps themselves if they need to run other commands.

All subprocesses are created with ``text=True`` and unbuffered
standard output to ensure that log messages appear immediately.
